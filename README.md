# ByteDance Bolt Parquet Reader
ByteDance's next generation universal high-performance Parquet Reader.

# Design Goal
The Bolt Parquet Reader is a native Parquet Reader in Rust language.

This design supports steaming reading, which allows to read the whole batch in smaller batches and reduce the peak memory cost. And, as a result, it is able to increase the overall parallelism.

Moreover, Bolt Parquet Reader is designed with a sophisticated filter push down strategies and range selectivity operations. Considering the consecutive reading progress, this feature is able to reduce unnecessary branching operations.

# Roadmap
This project is under actively development. You are more than welcomed to make contributions.

# How to Compile

### 1. Pull the code
```
git clone https://github.com/bytedance/bolt-parquet-reader.git
```

### 2. Prepare Rust Environment
```
# We recommend to use this version to enable zero copy features.
rustup install nightly-2022-11-03
```

### 3. Compile and Execute
```
cargo +nightly-2022-11-03 fmt --all -- --check
cargo +nightly-2022-11-03 build --package bolt-parquet-reader --lib
cargo +nightly-2022-11-03 test --verbose
cargo +nightly-2022-11-03 clippy --verbose
```
